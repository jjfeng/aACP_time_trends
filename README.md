## Installation

We recommend creating a virtual environment with Python 3.6.7 and installing packages listed in `requirements.txt`.

We use nestly + SCons to run simulations and data analyses. Note that scons should be installed outside the virtual environment, for a python 2.* or a 3.5+ environment. Then activate the virtual environment and then run `scons <experiment_folder_name>`.
