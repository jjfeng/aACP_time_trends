## Installation

We recommend creating a virtual environment with Python 3.6.7 and installing packages listed in `requirements.txt`.

We use `nestly` + SCons to run simulations and data analyses. Activate the virtual environment and then run `scons <experiment_folder_name>`.

## General pipeline

See `simulation_*` and `experiment_*` to reproduce the experiments in the paper.
